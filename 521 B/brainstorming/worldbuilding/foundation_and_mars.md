herer: Project 521




A civilian space program that died off years ago secretly launched a mission to mars a while ago. It was kept quiet because the governments don’t want private space exploration since it will ruin monopolies in favor of the one world order.

The power of open science and idealist benefactors was enough to get a small mars station started, but once the governments had access to technology that could cut off new supply missions by targeting it made it much more difficult if impossible, to get new supplies. 

521 was originally meant to be a new form of government in space, the first a-state colony, but soon after they were able to achieve sustainability, they realized something. Potenttially:

Life existed on mars, they think.

Life existed on mars, sort of. The same proto life that showed up early in evolution could be found on mars, but it looks as if it had arrived here,  not evolved. That means it came from somewhere. 

Maybe it was an accident.

Maybe there was a capsule they found that had this life, as well as information that they’re trying to decrypt. It seems like it was sent here.  

Maybe this ties into consciousness being tied into quantum physics and reality. There’s an idea of a great filter , and it’s really that consciousness is itself the great filter, because the universe is a simulation, and if consciousness meets a critical threshold then the simulation can affect the host of the simulation. 

Maybe we play with the idea that life exists as an efficient means to accelerate the entropic death of the universe. Consciousness is an emergent property if not synonymous with life. 

Maybe the life that any life here were wiped out by the creators because they figured this out and sent life out to land on mars but made it to earth by mistake in order to give us a fighting chance.




 

Origin Story


Project 521 started as a secret UN project focused on taking humanity interplanetary after a report detailed the risks of civilizational collapse due to varying threats like the nuclear bomb. The Foundation saw it as an escape option for themselves in the case of such a thing, but also as a place for them to create their society from scratch where they had control without needing to work within the framework of the modern global order and international entities. It was a sort of hedge of the bets. 

They recruited the greatest minds to work on the project, and were able to work with virtually limitless funding. The foundation privately funded the research and thus were able to outcompete the US government and USSR government during the space race. The technology was given t the Americans (older drafts) in order to ensure that they won the space race and would ensure that Space would become the new Wild West, not claimed by any country. The US agreed to keep things hush as long as they kept receiving technology from the foundation in return. 


Nixon tried to strong arm the foundation, which led to watergate. 

The mars colony was taking form, supplied with resources from the Foundation, but the progress was kept hushed up from the UN. The Foundation was growing suspicious of the growing American hostility to the foundation, and so they sought to hedge this risk. They worried the US would try and cull the ability of the Foundation to fund these projects. Eventually, Bank accounts and assets were being frozen, being linked to terrorist groups in impossible to invalidate ways. There were even teams and task forces dedicated to creating these paper trails. As part of the hedge, The foundation helped sponsor the work of an anonymous scientist, Satoshi Nakomoto, whose work could help create a new uncensorable monetary system. In exchange for their support, they would ensure the usage of the currency an give him the exclusive access to the initial pool of coins, making sure to not leave much of a trace for governments to tie it to. 




The Foundation




War trims scotiey’s hedges. It makes it more primal. Primal is more wild, but it’s easier to control a wild animal running off of instinct than a psychology student that can analyze the act of being controlled through critical thought. It’s hard to control a person, it’s easy to control a people. This is the philosophy of the Foundation. 


During the Gilded Age, rich businessmen began engaging in what would become known as anticompetitive behaviors that enabled them to work together to become richer and more powerful. Under royalty, businesses were under the thumb of the crown, but thanks to democracy, it was an opportunity to get out from under it and become the crown. This would only work so long as the people believed in the system they were supporting. They sought total control. But the world wasn’t ready for that. It needed to be globalized. So the group began manipulating global affairs, financing both sides of conflicts, creating the contexts needed for them to achieve their master plan of world domination through neoslavery of the commercialized masses, consumers. 

They needed an easier way to do this, so they created World War 2 in part to help create the justification for a global institution, the United Nations, which would facilitate the establishment of a global order that ensured *just* enough peace for global commerce. This would pave the way for the WEF, which would then act as a public face of the Foundation of sorts, as the foundation was really pulling the strings, and any time people wanted to blame a conspiracy they would blame the WEF while the foundation could stick to the shadows.


* Profit from Chaos: War means booming weapons manufacture, broken economies vulnerable to exploitation, and the opportunity to rewrite the rules. They see destruction as a lucrative enterprise.
* Global Management: They envision a world where unchallenged power rests in their hands. Wars allow them to play opposing sides, shaping outcomes to match their ultimate vision regardless of who superficially 'wins'.




## Core Philosophy & Central Mystery

The story is built on the following core premise:

**The universe is a simulation, and consciousness is the variable that can break it.**

The "Great Filter," a theoretical explanation for why intelligent life appears to be rare, is not an external event but an internal one. The Great Filter is consciousness itself. When a species' collective consciousness reaches a certain threshold of complexity and self-awareness, it begins to strain the resources of the simulation, or worse, becomes capable of perceiving and manipulating the simulation's underlying "code."

This premise connects the story's major philosophical themes:

*   **Simulation Theory:** The central conflict revolves around the characters proving that their reality is a simulation.
*   **The Nature of Life & Consciousness:** Life is a process within the simulation. Consciousness is an emergent property that, at a high level, acts like a user gaining "admin privileges" to reality.
*   **Free Will vs. Determinism:** The conflict between being programmed entities and the potential to make choices that genuinely alter the simulation's script.
*   **The Martian Discovery:** The capsule found by Project 521 is the story's catalyst. It contains proto-life and a message from a prior civilization that encountered this "Great Filter." The central mystery is the nature and purpose of this message.
