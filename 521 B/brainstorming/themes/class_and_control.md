# Theme: Class and Control

## Core Question
Who has the right to determine the fate of consciousness, and what gives them that authority?

## Inspiration from The Expanse
- **Resource Inequality**: The Foundation hoards consciousness-expanding technology while keeping others in ignorance
- **Physical vs. Digital Labor**: Mars colonists as unwitting computational resources for the simulation
- **Frontier Justice**: The colony operates under different rules, similar to Belt vs. Inner Planets dynamics

## Project 521 Applications
- **The Consciousness Divide**: Those who know about the simulation vs. those kept ignorant create a new class system
- **Computational Slavery**: Human consciousness being harvested as processing power without consent
- **Information as Currency**: Knowledge about reality's true nature becomes the ultimate valuable resource
- **Evolutionary Control**: The Foundation decides which traits and ideas get to continue in the simulation

## Character Archetypes
- **The Custodian**: Foundation member who genuinely believes they're protecting humanity
- **The Revolutionary**: Colonist who wants to expose the truth regardless of consequences
- **The Collaborator**: Someone who knows the truth but benefits from the current system
- **The Innocent**: Unaware participants whose reactions drive moral questions

## Power Structures
- **Hierarchical**: Foundation → Earth governments → Mars colony → Individual consciousness
- **Information Control**: Reality itself becomes classified information
- **Technological Gatekeeping**: Only the elite understand how consciousness manipulation works

## Real-World Parallels
- Tech companies controlling information flow and digital identity
- Corporate surveillance and behavioral manipulation
- Economic systems that depend on keeping populations unaware of exploitation
- Climate change and generational responsibility

## Visual/Thematic Elements
- **Vertical Architecture**: Physical representations of hierarchy (Earth skyscrapers vs. Mars underground)
- **Data Streams**: Visual metaphors for consciousness being harvested
- **Isolation Pods**: Physical separation reflecting social stratification

## Moral Complexity
- Is it better to live a comfortable lie or a harsh truth?
- Do the enlightened have an obligation to wake others?
- Can control ever be justified if it prevents existential suffering?
