# Project 521 - Organization System

## Directory Structure

### `/brainstorming/`
Raw ideas, early concepts, loose thoughts. Nothing here is committed to canon.

- `characters/` - Character concepts and development
- `worldbuilding/` - World concepts, history, organizations
  - `locations/` - Places in the story world
  - `technology/` - Tech concepts and capabilities  
  - `science/` - Scientific concepts and accuracy
  - `history/` - Timeline and background events
- `plot/` - Story structure and narrative
  - `arcs/` - Major story arcs
  - `subplots/` - Secondary storylines
  - `scenes/` - Individual scene concepts
- `themes/` - Philosophical and thematic exploration
- `style/` - Visual and stylistic concepts
- `misc/` - Random ideas and inspiration

### `/canon/`
Finalized, committed story elements. Only move things here when you're confident.
(Same subcategory structure as brainstorming)

### `/research/`
Scientific accuracy, real-world references, fact-checking
- `science/` - Scientific concept research
- `technology/` - Real-world tech development
- `references/` - Expert sources, papers, interviews

### `/production/`
When ready to write/produce
- `outlines/` - Final story outlines
- `drafts/` - Script drafts
- `scripts/` - Final scripts

## Workflow

1. **Brainstorm** - Capture ideas in `/brainstorming/`
2. **Research** - Verify science in `/research/`
3. **Canonize** - Move solid concepts to `/canon/`
4. **Produce** - Create final content in `/production/`

## Templates

Each directory contains `_template.md` files to help structure new entries consistently.

## Scientific Accuracy Priority

This project prioritizes scientific plausibility. Every scientific concept should have real-world foundation and reasonable extrapolation documented in `/research/`.
